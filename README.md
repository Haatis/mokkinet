Cabin Reservation App.

How to Run:

Clone the project.
Navigate to the server folder and rename .envExample to .env.
Create a MySQL database using the schema.sql file (located in the server folder).
Populate the .env file with the necessary information to connect the backend to the database (you can use any value for SECRET_KEY; it's only for password hashing).
To run the server and client, open the main folder in the terminal. For the server, execute cd server followed by npm start. Repeat the process for the client with cd client and npm start.
